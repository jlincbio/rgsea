## *rgsea*: a new R implementation of GSEA-P-R

Originally developed by the Broad Institute as an standalone R program in 2005, GSEA-P-R has no longer been actively maintained since 2005. This is an attemp to modernize the code for R versions 3.3 or above. The goal of this project is to repackage the original concepts of GSEA-P-R into a package and improve its performance.

First version: Oct. 25, 2019
